Security & Ethics

Legal Notice
This tool is for educational and authorized testing purposes only.

- Only scan domains you own or have explicit written permission to test
- Respect robots.txt and website terms of service
- Use reasonable rate limits to avoid overwhelming servers
- Follow responsible disclosure practices for any vulnerabilities found

Best Practices
- Start with low thread counts (10-25) for initial testing
- Use longer timeouts for slower networks
- Monitor system resources during large scans
- Document all testing activities for compliance

Educational Value

This project demonstrates:
- DNS Protocol Understandin: Comprehensive DNS record enumeration
- Network Programming: HTTP/HTTPS protocols and socket programming
- Concurrent Programming: Multi-threading with ThreadPoolExecutor
- Error Handling: Robust exception management and timeout controls
- Cybersecurity Concepts: Reconnaissance techniques and ethical hacking
- Software Engineering: CLI design, testing, and documentation

Key Improvements

This enhanced version addresses several issues from basic implementations:

Fixes Applied:
- Fixed Critical Typo: `discivered_subdomains` â†’ `discovered_subdomains`
- Enhanced Error Handling: Comprehensive exception management
- Improved Threading: ThreadPoolExecutor for controlled concurrency
- Added CLI Support: Professional command-line argument parsing

Features Added:
- Multiple Output Formats: JSON, CSV, TXT support
- HTTP/HTTPS Testing: Both protocols with status code analysis
- Performance Monitoring: Statistics tracking and reporting
- Server Fingerprinting: Web server identification
- Professional Output: Banners, progress indicators, summaries

Performance Benchmarks

| Thread Count | Requests/Second | Recommended Use Case |
|--------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| 10-25        | 15-30          | Initial testing, slow networks |
| 50-100       | 30-60          | Standard scanning |
| 100+         | 60-100+        | High-speed authorized testing |
